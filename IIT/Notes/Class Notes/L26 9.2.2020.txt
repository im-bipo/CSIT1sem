NIC
Network Interface Card:
NIC provides the hardware interface between a computer and a network, 
regardless of whether the network is wired or wireless since the NIC
can be used for Ethernet networks as well as Wi-Fi ones.

"Network cards" that connect over USB are not actually cards but 
instead regular USB devices that enable network connections through 
the USB port. These are called network adapters.

Network interface card NIC is a hardware component, where network controllers 
are integrated on to a circuit board that uses standard OSI model of 7 layers 
to communicate and it acts like a trans-receiver, where it can transmit and 
receives at the same time while communicating with other devices.
